## Project Theme:

The business organization, while thriving in profitability and market share, has identified a rising attrition rate as a concern. As a Business Analyst, the responsibility is to delve into the provided employee data, creating a comprehensive data analysis report that addresses the HR team's analytical queries. This report will not only illuminate the reasons behind the increased attrition but also offer key insights to inform strategic decision-making for HR management.

## Tools Implemented:

* Microsoft Power BI
* PostgrqeSQL and pgAdmin 4
* Microsoft Excel.

## Development Approach:

Our project development approach was structured in a series of steps to ensure comprehensive understanding, transformation, and visualization of the source data, all while aligning with the business problems we aimed to address. Starting with a meticulous analysis of the raw data and business goals, we utilized Microsoft Power BI for ETL operations, data transformation, and shaping. The focus was on creating relationships among tables, establishing DAX measures, and building a dynamic and interactive dashboard tailored to managerial-level stakeholders. To validate our analysis, we used PostgreSQL and pgAdmin 4 for extensive data validation, implementing advanced SQL concepts across 140+ queries. The outcome was a comprehensive 'Data Validation Report' to confirm accuracy and reliability of our data-driven insights.

The Project Development comprises following key steps-
1. Understanding Source data and analytical goals.
2. Transforming and Shaping source data (Data Cleaning) .
3. Data Modelling.
4. Creating DAX measures.
5. Data Visualization OR Dashboarding .
6. Analysis Validation.
7. Extract key Insights.
